# Safari City Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains CSV datasets extracted from an Excel sheet, used for analyzing game time, geographic distribution, and other metrics related to safari activities. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook, and an analytical dashboard is built to visualize the insights. The dashboard provides geographic and game-time analysis for the safari data.
## Prerequisites
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
Git (to clone the repository)

Setup Instructions

Clone the RepositoryClone this repository to your local machine:
